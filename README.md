📧 Spam Classification Using Logistic Regression

This project implements a Spam Classification system using Machine Learning, developed during a hands-on ML bootcamp/workshop. The goal is to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Spam detection is a classic NLP problem with real-world applications in email filtering and message moderation.
In this project, we:

Preprocess raw text data

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data handling

Scikit-learn – ML modeling & evaluation

TF-IDF Vectorizer – Feature extraction

Jupyter Notebook
